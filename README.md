- # Generate Realistic Fashion Images Using Deep Learning

# 📌 Project Overview

- This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic fashion items such as shirts, shoes, bags, and accessories. The generator learns to create new images from random noise, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and fake fashion images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

# 🧠 What is a GAN?

- A GAN consists of two neural networks trained in competition:

- Generator 🤖 — Creates new fake images

- Discriminator 🕵️ — Detects whether images are real or fake

# 🧩 Dataset

# 📍 Fashion-MNIST (28x28 grayscale images)

Classes include:
👗 Dress | 👕 Shirt | 👚 Top | 👠 Sandal | 👞 Shoe | 🎒 Bag | 🧥 Coat | 🧦 Ankle Boot

# 🔧 Tech Stack

| Component     | Library            |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Framework     | TensorFlow / Keras |
| Visualization | Matplotlib         |
| Dataset       | Fashion-MNIST      |

# 🚀 Features

✅ Generates new fashion images from noise
✅ Stable training using LeakyReLU + Adam optimizer
✅ Image scaling with tanh for realistic output
✅ Visual progress monitoring during training

# Results

- Generated images improve over epochs — shapes become clearer and closely resemble Fashion-MNIST classes like:

- Shirts 👕

- Shoes 👟

- Bags 🎒
