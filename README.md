# StyleSynth
This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic Fashion-MNIST images such as shirts, shoes, and bags. The generator learns to create fake fashion items from random noise, while the discriminator distinguishes fake from real images. Through adversarial training, produces visually meaningful fashion images.
